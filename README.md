# Yale Squash Ladder

A ranking system, using the same algorithm as the [chess rating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system) to provide a ladder for independent squash players at Yale.

Incorporates the functionality of reporting and scheduling matches, viewing your rating and rank and adding available times so others can challenge you!
